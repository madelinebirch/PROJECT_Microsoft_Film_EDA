   # DSC-Flex Phase 1 Project: Microsoft's Journey into Film: 3 Key Business Recommendations to Maximize Profit


## Determining dependent variable
  When pondering the possible dependent ariables I could measure the data against, I decided that 'profit' would be the most suitable. For a corporation like Microsoft, it made most sense to me that total net profit would be of highest interest to stakeholders. Where gross revenue can give an impressive look at how a specific film did in the boxoffice, both domestic and worldwide, net profit gives us the most accurate view on the company's financial health following an investment as grand as a movie production. Net profit provides payment to C-suite, reimburses production expenses, and increases the overall value of the company for shareholders across the globe.


## Choosing independent variables to measure against profit

  3 variables stood out as most helpful when giving recommendations on how to maximize profit: budget, genre, and release month.

### Independent variable 1: budget

According to the Data, high budgets tend overall to yield high profits. In this case, a high budget of over 100,000,000 USD can yield profits up to 1,433,854,864 - 2,351,345,279 USD. That's billions of potential dollars for Microsoft. They must ensure they spend high budgets wisely by hiring the best writers, actors, and production teams available to build the highest profitable film studio possible. A boxplot shows a high budget to high profit correlation. The box indicating high budget prodution is much longer and higher than the low and mid budget boxes, which shows that 50% of high budget films have a budget of over 100,000,000 and generate the highest profit. Microsoft has the potential to be as successful as James Cameron's Avatar, which made over 2 BILLION USD in profit! Wow.

### Independent variable 2: genre

After manipulating and analyzing the data to find which genres have trended to yield highest profits, we come upon the top 4: Action, Family, Adventure, and Science Fiction, all of which combined yield an average profit between 782,465,326 USD and 940,063,384 USD, with Action averaging the highest. WOW! Make an action movie, Microsoft! Think Top Gun, Avengers, anything with high intensity action sequences and fight scenes with a hero vs. villain plot arc. 

### Independent variable 3: release month

The time of year in which a film is release matters greatly to the studio's profit outcomes. Let's make a copy and sort through our previous DataFrame, clean it, and sort it to see which months yiled highest net revenues. A line graph profits skyrocketing between May and July, peaking the highest in June, with average profits hitting 16,142,140 USD. Profits spike again during the Holidays, hitting 11,571,850 USD in December. If Microsoft wants to be successful and reap the highest possible profit, they ought to market and release their films as either Summer or Christmas/New Years blockbuster events.
